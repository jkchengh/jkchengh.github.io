I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the Aeronautics and Astronautics Department at MIT, advised by [Prof. Brian C. Williams](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/brian-c-williams). My research interests are primarily in the areas of planning and scheduling, control, combinatorial search, and mathematical optimization with the applications in interconnected robotic systems for manufacturing and warehouse logistics. 

Before MIT, I obtained my B.E. degree in Control Science and Engineering from Chu Kochen Honors College at Zhejiang University in 2016. Previously, I was furtunate to work with [Dr. Dimitrios Pantazis](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/dimitrios-pantazis/) at McGovern Institute of Brian Research, [Prof. Mario Gerla](http://nrlweb.cs.ucla.edu/nrlweb/people/show/15) at UCLA Network Research Lab, and [Prof. Jiming Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/jmchen) at Zhejiang University NeSC Lab.
