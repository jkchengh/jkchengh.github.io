I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My advisor is Professor [Brian C. Williams](http://people.csail.mit.edu/williams/Web%20site/williams.shtml). Before MIT, I received my B.E degree in Control Science and Technology from Chu Kochen Honors Colleges at Zhejiang University.

My research interests are primarily in the areas of planning and scheduling, control, combinatorial search, and mathematical optimization with the applications in interconnected robotic systems for manufacturing and warehouse logistics.
