I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the Aeronautics and Astronautics Department at MIT, advised by Professor [Brian C. Williams](http://people.csail.mit.edu/williams/Web%20site/williams.shtml). Before MIT, I obtained my B.E degree in Control Science and Technology from Chu Kochen Honors Colleges at Zhejiang University in 2016.

My research interests are primarily in the areas of planning and scheduling, control, combinatorial search, and mathematical optimization with the applications in interconnected robotic systems for manufacturing and warehouse logistics.
