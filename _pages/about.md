I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the Aeronautics and Astronautics Department at MIT, advised by [Professor Brian C. Williams](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/brian-c-williams) and [Professor Chuchu Fan](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/about/people/chuchu-fan). Before MIT, I obtained my B.E. degree in Control Science and Engineering from Chu Kochen Honors College at Zhejiang University in 2016. Previously, he worked in McGovern Institute at Brian research with [Dr. Dimitrios Pantazis](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/dimitrios-pantazis/), UCLA Network Research Lab with [Professor Mario Gerla](http://nrlweb.cs.ucla.edu/nrlweb/people/show/15), and Zhejiang University NeSC Lab with [Professor Jiming Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/jmchen).

My research interests are primarily in the areas of planning and scheduling, control, combinatorial search, and mathematical optimization with the applications in interconnected robotic systems for manufacturing and warehouse logistics.
